# Tip-Calculator-Android-App-

Tip Calculator is a simple mobile android app I made using Android Studio.

USAGE:

There are two fields: one is where you enter amount to be paid before applying tip and the second is the tip percentage to be applied.
When you press Calculate Tip, it will display the tip amount and the total amount due. For instance, if you enter 10.00 into "Enter Amount" field and 15 into Tip % field, it will display $1.50 in Tip Amount and $11.50 for total amount due.
